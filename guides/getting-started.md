era# 🐝 Getting Started with Beekeeping

Welcome to your first steps in beekeeping! This guide covers the essentials for setting up your apiary, choosing equipment, and caring for your bees.

## 📍 1) Choosing the Right Hive

Your hive style affects management, honey harvest, and inspections. Common options include:

- **Langstroth Hive** – Most popular; stacked boxes with removable frames.
- **Top-Bar Hive** – Horizontal design; simple inspections but less standardized.
- **Warre Hive** – Vertical but smaller boxes; aims to mimic natural bee environments.

## 🛠 2) Essential Equipment Checklist

Before you bring bees home, make sure you have:

- [ ] **Protective Gear:** veil, gloves, bee suit or jacket.
- [ ] **Smoker:** calms bees during inspections.
- [ ] **Hive Tool:** pry apart frames and boxes.
- [ ] **Brush:** gently move bees when needed.
- [ ] **Feeders:** for syrup feeding in spring/fall or during dearth.
- [ ] **Queen Excluder (optional):** keeps queen out of honey supers.

## 🐝 3) Getting Your Bees

Two common ways to start a colony:

✅ **Nucleus Colony (Nuc)**  
- 4–5 frames with queen, brood, and workers.
- Faster buildup; ideal for beginners.

✅ **Package Bees**  
- Loose bees in a box with a caged queen.
- Cheaper but slower to establish.

## 📅 4) Setting Up Your Apiary

Choose a site with:

- **Sunlight:** morning sun helps bees start early.
- **Wind Protection:** natural barriers or fences reduce stress.
- **Water Source:** nearby water (or provide shallow water with pebbles).
- **Good Drainage:** avoid flooding during rain.

## 🐛 6) Monitoring for Pests & Diseases

Learn to identify and manage common issues:

- **Varroa mites** – treat proactively; monitor with sticky boards or alcohol washes.
- **American Foulbrood (AFB)** – bacterial disease; highly contagious.
- **Chalkbrood** – fungal; improves with hive ventilation.
