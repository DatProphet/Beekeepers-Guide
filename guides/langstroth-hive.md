The **Langstroth hive** is the most widely used beehive design in the world. It was invented by Reverend Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth in 1852, revolutionizing modern beekeeping.

## 🧩 Key Features

✅ **Modular design** — hives consist of stacked rectangular boxes (deeps and mediums)  
✅ **Removable frames** — allow easy inspections and honey extraction  
✅ **Bee space** — precise 3/8” gaps reduce excess propolis and burr comb  
✅ **Scalable** — add supers for honey production as your colony grows
